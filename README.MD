###  CraftNanny is a modular program built for [ComputerCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/computercraft) on Minecraft. It allows you to manage various tasks like tracking fluid and energy info, sending redstone signals, and much more, all through a php/lua interaction.


Dev Repo Is for me to use only for adding and or testing new thing once fully tested it will then be ported over to prod branch of the repo
